# Web debugging #0
In this first project of debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks were given issued, the objective being to come up with a Bash script that once executed, brings the webstack to a working state. As advised by the program creator(ALX), before writing the Bash script, it's prudent to figure out what is going on and fix it manually.
