# Web stack debugging #4
In this last project of the web stack debugging series, I was fixing the `Nginx` web server to serve a large number of requests using a `Puppet` manifest. This was to ensure that our web server set-up is very efficient when put under pressure.
I also learnt how to change user limits in the OS configuration to handle opening of large number of hard and soft files.
