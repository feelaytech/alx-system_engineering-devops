# API Advanced
In this project, I learnt and implemented the following on [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/):

  - How to read API documentation to find the endpoints I'm looking for
  - How to use an API with pagination
  - How to parse JSON results from an API
  - How to make a recursive API call
  - How to sort a dictionary by value
