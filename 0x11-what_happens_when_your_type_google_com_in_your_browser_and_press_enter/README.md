# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter?
In this project, I wrote a blog on Medium on what goes on under the hood when one types google.com in their browser and presses enter. I discussed various web infrastructure components that make it possible to send client requests to servers and finally get responses from the queried servers to the browser for view by the user.

I also made a pull request to a repository where folks from the GitHub community are also in the quest to demystify the architecture behind a URL journey.
