# HTTPS SSL
In this project, I learnt the two main roles of HTTPS SSL, the purpose of encrypting traffic and SSL termination.
## HTTPS SSL 2 Main Roles:
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) serve two primary roles:

- **Authentication:** SSL certificates are used to verify the identity of a website or server. When you connect to a website over HTTPS, your browser checks the SSL certificate to ensure that you are indeed connecting to the legitimate site and not a malicious one. This authentication helps establish trust between the user's browser and the server.

- **Encryption:** SSL also provides encryption for the data transmitted between your browser and the web server. It ensures that the information exchanged, such as login credentials, personal data, or credit card numbers, is scrambled into unreadable text (cipher) during transit. This encryption safeguards the data from eavesdroppers, making it secure even if intercepted.

## Purpose of Encrypting Traffic:
The purpose of encrypting traffic in HTTPS SSL is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the internet. Here's why it's important:

- Confidentiality: Encryption ensures that even if someone intercepts the data being sent, they can't read it without the decryption key. This protects sensitive information like login details, financial transactions, and personal data from being stolen or misused.

- Integrity: Encryption also guarantees that the data hasn't been tampered with during transit. If any unauthorized changes occur in the data, the decryption process will fail, alerting both the sender and receiver that something is amiss.

In essence, encrypting traffic helps maintain privacy, security, and trust between users and websites, making it a fundamental component of secure online communication.

## SSL Termination:
SSL termination, also known as SSL offloading, is a process in which SSL encryption and decryption are handled by a device or server before the data reaches its final destination. Here's how it works:

When a client (e.g., a web browser) initiates an HTTPS connection with a web server, it sends an encrypted request.
An intermediate device (e.g., a load balancer or a reverse proxy server) terminates the SSL connection by decrypting the request.
Once decrypted, the device can inspect the request, apply security policies, and make routing decisions.
The device then re-encrypts the request and sends it to the backend web server.
The backend server processes the request, generates a response, and sends it back to the intermediate device.
The intermediate device decrypts the response, inspects or modifies it if necessary, re-encrypts it, and sends it back to the client.
SSL termination can improve server performance and security because it offloads the resource-intensive encryption/decryption tasks from backend servers while allowing for traffic inspection and load balancing. It's often used in high-traffic environments to optimize server resources and enhance security.
