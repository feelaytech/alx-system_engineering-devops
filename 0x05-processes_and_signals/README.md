# Processes and signals
In this project, I learnt about Linux and UNIX system calls, signals and process management.
A process can be thought of as an instance of a program in execution. We called this an ‘instance of a program’, because if the same program is run lets say 10 times then there will be 10 corresponding processes.

A signal, on the other hand, is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.
