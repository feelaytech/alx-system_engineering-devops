# Web Stack Debugging #2
In this challenge, I was tasked to write bash scripts to manage user root which is the "superuser", which is to say, the user with all the priviledges to perform any action on the server terminal/environment.
I mostly learned how to make sure that web servers are configured to always deny root user log ins to counter adverse impact for unauthorized users(attackers) on my web servers. This way their access will be restricted to the less priviledged users that we created.
