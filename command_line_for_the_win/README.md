# Command line for the win
This is an awesome challenge provided by the ALX Holberton Software Engineering School to be completed as an optional project for the curriculum.

## Background Context
[CMD CHALLENGE](https://cmdchallenge.com) is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

I tested my Bash skills that I had already learnt earlier in the program on a series of random tests(about 30 and counting) and I got to learn even more skills that can be very handy in System DevOps projects.

## SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool
Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a network protocol for securely accessing, transferring and managing large files and sensitive data.

In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required screenshots to GitHub, I was tasked to demonstrate the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move my local screenshots to the sandbox environment.

**Here are the steps I took to achieve just that:**
- I had my `.png` screenshot files in my local machine which I could easily access using my `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` terminal. In my ALX hosted sandbox environment, I'm provided with a `hostname`, `username`, and `password` to initiate SFTP command-line tool in my local terminal. Once SFTP is launched, I now have a secure connection to the sandbox environment.
- I had to learn a few `sftp` commands on the `man page` using `?` command. I used the usual shell commands `mkdir`, `cd`, `ls` to navigate to `/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/` folder in the remote sandbox environment. This is where I transferred the screenshots from my local machine.
- In `sftp command-line tool`, I'm able to access my directories in the local machine as well using these commands: `lcd`, `lls` and so forth. I used these to get to the folder that had my screenshots. From here I used the `put` command to upload these screenshots(`0-first_9_tasks.png`, `1-next_9_tasks.png` and `2-next_9_tasks.png`) to my remote sandbox in the designated folder.
- I confirmed the transfer was successful using the `ls` command which lists the uploaded `.png` files.
- After that, I proceeded accordingly with the usual upload to the remote Github repository. I also learnt the `get` sftp command used to download remote files from the server host to my local terminal.
